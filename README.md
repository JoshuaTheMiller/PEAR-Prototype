# üçê Pseudo Electronic Assembly-line Reflector üçê

Or PEAR, for short. Pear is a prototype software suite created to demonstrate the application of various technologies to solve some potential real-world problem(s).

## What problem(s)?

Imagine many disparate machines that are all outputting tons of data, from errors that occurred to amount of work done, all in different formats. Now imagine wanting to view all of that data in a standardized format from anywhere in the world, securely.

Has this been done before? Yes (e.g. RA). Will this whole project be for naught then? No. Learning about different software systems is a personal goal of this project. 

## Initial Component Outline

There are various tasks that should be accomplished for this project.

*This list is subject to change.*

1. Development environments should be able to be spun up without much effort.
1. Accessing/submitting data to any storage mechanism should be authenticated.
1. Accessing/submitting data to any storage mechanism should be secure.
1. The mechanism for submitting data must not be machine specific.
1. Deployments/updates of the storage mechanism should result in zero downtime.
1. The data should be able to be accessed from anywhere in the world.
1. In general, all software for this project should be highly available, highly reliable, disaster resistant, portable, and secure.
